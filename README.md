# Portfolio
My personal portfolio. 

*Originally formatted for a school Assignment*

**Portfolio 2.0 Traveling through the Decades**

When I first started programming I was in the 5th Grade, while I did not know much or even really well, I played around with an old computer, and tinkered with websites and so on. By the time I was 12/13 years old I understood most of the basic front end languages, html/js/css. By the time I was 15 I knew .NET languages like VB and C#. 

To this day I continue to learn more and more each day. 

This portfolio demonstrates how far we have come in technology, from the 1990s, to the early 2000's. To now. 

Each design - demostrates each era of technology and everything in each, is uisng the methods and functions of that time period. 

My skills are kinda like how the techlology has progressed in the last 20 years. My skills show how well I have grapsed each concept. 

WIP.
