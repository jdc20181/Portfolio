    <h1> About Me Jeffrey! </h1>

     <p>
       I am Jeffrey, or on github I am known as Jdc20181, I consider myself a introduction professional, this is simply because I am not a professional by no means, but I have 2 years of experience in programming!
  </p>
  <p> In additon to programming - I am a pretty good writer, but that's not where I am best. As a programmer it is important to know proper grammar, and organize your work. 
    After all those years, I finally found a good use for a flow chart!</p>
  
  <p> So, dimmed down here is brief on my skills 
  <br>
    <ul>
      <li> HTML5 </li>
      <li> CSS </li>
      <li> Basic JS (Currently learning it in more advance stages) </li>
      <li> VB.net </li>
      <li> Wordpress Developer </li>
  </p>
   
 <p> Since 2014 I have been studying about programming, as a highschool student I am planning my entire career around it, so it is pretty important!
   In 2015, I downloaded Visual studio for the first time and began learning VB.net. After starting that I also picked up on web programming as well. 
   My current weakness is not knowing much about messing with databases, while I  have knowledge of using wordpress to the core, I have some limitations. I am more 
   of the design, and basic website builder (in terms of basic, I mean no login functions etc.) I could do that but, perfer not to mess with them. </p>
